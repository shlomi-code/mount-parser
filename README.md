## About

`mount-parser` is a lightweight Python utility designed to parse and convert raw mount entries (typically obtained from the `mount` command output on Unix-like systems) into a more human-readable and structured format. Instead of deciphering cryptic mount options and device paths, `mount-parser` helps you quickly understand the essential details of a mounted filesystem.

This tool is particularly useful for system administrators, developers, and anyone who frequently interacts with Linux/Unix filesystem mounts and desires a clearer representation of the `mount` command's output.

## Features

- **Parses standard `mount` output:** Handles various formats of mount entries.
- **Human-readable output:** Converts technical details into an easy-to-understand text.
- **Extracts key information:** Clearly presents the device, mount point, filesystem type, and options.
- **Pythonic:** Easy to integrate into other Python scripts or workflows.
- **Command-line utility:** Can be used directly from the terminal for quick lookups.
